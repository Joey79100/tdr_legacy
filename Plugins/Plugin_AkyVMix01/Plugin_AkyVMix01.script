<START_CONSTANTS>
PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS: 1 ;Used with Parameters command.>"Not holding" conditions are not really good for "the weapon is holstered" conditions, because in that case the holstering/extracting movements are also included. That is why this constant in C165 condition triggers will perform a better "holstered" condition.>>Note:>"The weapon is on Lara's back" also means now it is holstered. It is clearly not a "holster", though.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS, IdParamList, Flags (FHOLST_...), WeaponSlot, ExtractFrame, HolsterFrame>>Examples>-------->Example1 (The moment when the crossbow, the selected weapon - just being extracted - just leaves Lara's back):>>     Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS, 1, IGNORE, CROSSBOW_ITEM, 10, IGNORE>>Or (The moment when the pistol, the selected weapon - just being extracted - just leaves Lara's holsters):>>     Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS, 2, IGNORE, PISTOLS_ITEM, 13, IGNORE>>Example2 (The moment when the crossbow, the selected weapon - just being holstered - just touches Lara's back):>>     Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS, 3, IGNORE, CROSSBOW_ITEM, IGNORE, 24>>Or (The moment when the pistol, the selected weapon - just being holstered - just touches Lara's holsters):>>     Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS, 4, IGNORE, PISTOLS_ITEM, IGNORE, 13>>Example3 (The crossbow, the selected weapon is just holstered between the holstering moment of Example2 and the extracting moment of Example1, or between the moment of picking it up and the extracting moment of Example1):>>     Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS, 5, FHOLST_SELECTED, CROSSBOW_ITEM, 10, 24>>Or (The pistol, either the selected weapon or not, is just holstered between the holstering moment of Example2 and the extracting moment of Example1, or between the moment of picking it up and the extracting moment of Example1):>>     Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS, 6, IGNORE, PISTOLS_ITEM, IGNORE, IGNORE>>Note:>Example3 is true even if the weapon you can see in the holsters/on Lara's back is just not this weapon.>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS command, 2 for second etc.>>Flags (FHOLST_...) field>------------------------->You should choose here if the weapon is the selected one or not. If you type IGNORE, then it doesn't matter if it is the selected weapon or not.>(You don't need any flag if the command checks only the extracting/holstering moments, because in those cases we can be naturally sure that it is the selected weapon.)>>WeaponSlot field>---------------->Type the weapon name (PISTOLS_ITEM, SHOTGUN_ITEM etc.) what you want the command for.>>ExtractFrame field>------------------>See the required animation in WADMerger Animation Editor. You need to identify which is the very first frame when the required shotgun, grenade gun, crossbow weapon leaves perfectly the holsters (or Lara's back). For example, if it is the default extracting animation of the crossbow, then you can see it is probably Frame10. So you need to type 10 now in this field.>>If it is pistol, revolver or Uzi, then it is not (!) a frame of this animation. It is a bit complicated to explain. That is why all I say is these are the frames I suggest (for the default animations):>>-pistols: 13>-revolver: 15>-Uzis: 13>>If you edit the animation, then you should use the "plus/minus one, two, three etc. frames" method to find the proper frame in the "trial and error" way.>>The required animations are:>>-pistols: PISTOLS_ANIM Animation 2>-revolver: SIXSHOOTER_ANIM Animation 2>-Uzis: UZI_ANIM Animation 2>-shotgun: SHOTGUN_ANIM Animation 1>-grenade gun: GREMADE_GUN_ANIM Animation 0>-crossbow: CROSSBOW_ANIM Animation 1>>Type IGNORE here if you check only the holstering moment of the weapon.>Also type IGNORE if you check the whole holstered position, for pistol, revolver, Uzi.>>Important note!>Never forget to check this frame in this field, each time when you edit this animation.>>HolsterFrame field>------------------>See the required animation in WADMerger Animation Editor. You need to identify which is the very first frame when the required shotgun, grenade gun, crossbow weapon touches perfectly the holsters (or Lara's back). For example, if it is the default extracting animation of the crossbow, then you can see it is probably Frame24. So you need to type 24 now in this field.>If it is pistol, revolver, Uzi, then it is the same frame and required animation that is mentioned at ExtractFrame field.>>The required animations are:>>-shotgun: SHOTGUN_ANIM Animation 3>-grenade gun: GREMADE_GUN_ANIM Animation 5>-crossbow: CROSSBOW_ANIM Animation 3>>Type IGNORE here if you check only the extracting moment of the weapon.>Also type IGNORE if you check the whole holstered position, for pistol, revolver, Uzi.>>Important note!>Never forget to check this frame in this field, each time when you edit this animation.

FHOLST_SELECTED:$0001; Used with Parameters=PARAM_WEAPON_HOLSTERS command.>This flag is needed if you want to use the command only if the weapon is selected.>(You don't need this flag if the command checks only the extracting/holstering moments, because in those cases we can be naturally sure that it is the selected weapon.)>>Note:>We don't need a constant for "if the weapon is not selected" now, because a non-selected weapon is never being extracted or holstered. If you want an "if X non-selected weapon is holstered" condition, then you need a "No weapon (holstered without animation or disarmed)" of C167 and an "In holsters/on back (with extractimg/holstering)" for X weapon of C164. Place those conditions together in a TriggerGroup (can be called eg. with a C15).

CUST_START_WEAPON: 1 ;Used with Customize command, place it in the [Level] section of the first level of your game.>This constant will set another selected weapon instead of the pistols, when the game starts.>>Syntax: Customize=CUST_START_WEAPON, WeaponSlot, AmmoType, AmmoAmount, LaserSightStatus, PistolStatus>>The command places the required weapon and ammo in the inventory and also attaches the lasersight, if you want. And also the proper weapon mesh will be seeable in her holsters/on her back. (After all, this command is a special version of F408 trigger.)>>WeaponSlot field>---------------->Type the weapon name (SHOTGUN_ITEM, SIXSHOOTER_ITEM etc.) of this starting weapon.>>AmmoType field>-------------->Type the ammo type here (SHOTGUN_AMMO2_ITEM, CROSSBOW_AMMO2_ITEM, CROSSBOW_AMMO3_ITEM, GRENADE_GUN_AMMO2_ITEM, GRENADE_GUN_AMMO3_ITEM) that you want in this weapon, if the weapon has more ammo types. If you type IGNORE here, then the weapon will be loaded with the default ammo (AMMO1).>Also type IGNORE if it is a weapon only with one ammo type (pistols, Uzis, revolver).>>AmmoAmount field>---------------->Type here the ammo amount you want in the weapon. The limit is usually 32767 bullets, but only 5461 for shotgun ammo.>If you type IGNORE, then the ammo will be infinite. (You can force a countable value with an "Inventory-Item" flipeffect later, to remove the infinite status during the game.)>>LaserSightStatus field>---------------------->Type LASERSIGHT_ITEM here if you want the lasersight to be attached to the weapon.>Type IGNORE if you don't want that or if it is a weapon where you can't use the lasersight.>>PistolStatus field>------------------>Type a number here (maximum 32767), if you want to keep the pistols and their ammo. That number will be the bullet amount for the pistols. (Type IGNORE, if the amount remains the default "unlimited".)>Type 0 if you want to remove the pistols and their ammo.

PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION: 2 ;Used with Parameters command.>I used this possibility in the condition triggers to host "more", "less" an "equal" situations, if:>>-I needed more than two parameters in the trigger, but>-I didn't want to define a complex PARAM constant, because I needed PARAM only to check this relation.>So what this constant do is only host a number, saying it is "more", "less" or "equal".>>And I also chose this solution for "more", "less" an "equal" situations, if I didn't want to waste the limited slots of PARAM_BIG_NUMBERS for this kind of condition.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION, IdParamList, Relation flags (FREL...), Number >>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION command, 2 for second etc.>>Relation flags (FREL...) field>------------------------------>Type here a FREL_... constant, to define if you want a "more", "less" or "equal" relation now.>>Number field>------------>Type the number here for the relation.>It must be between -32768 and 32767.>>Example1 (if the observed number is equal with 150):>Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION, 1, FREL_EQUAL, 150>>Example2 (if the observed number is more than -2794):>Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION, 2, FREL_MORE, -2794>>Example3 (if the observed number is less than 25185 or equal with it):>Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION, 3, FREL_LESS+FREL_EQUAL, 25185>>Let's see eg. how it works with C169:>>; Set Trigger Type - CONDITION 169>; Exporting: CONDITION(169:34) for PARAMETER(25) {Plugin_AkyVMix01}>; (#) :  Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION,    25>; (&) :  Lara. (Holds) Lara ignites a flame/torch at (#) frame of (E) way>; (E) :  The torch or a flame (Animation 427 - Flame is 0-1 clicks high)>>Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION, 25, FREL_MORE+FREL_EQUAL, 20>>So the condition is true if the animation just performs the part between Frame 20 and the last frame of the animation, when Lara ignites her torch with a flame or a flame with her torch. So in the period when Lara touches the torch to the flame, ruling out the period of the animation when Lara only moves the torch to the flame.>>Note:>If you need a narrowed interval (eg. between Frame20 and Frame28), then you need another C169 as well, referring to another PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION (with "less" or "less+equal" flag, and 28). Place those two conditions together in a TriggerGroup (can be called eg. with a C15). - This is naturally true for any other trigger with PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION.>Moreover, a narrowed interval could be really useful sometimes. I mean, I don’t really recommend “equal” conditions in many cases, because they are usually never true, they are “too exact”. See eg. C198 for distances on ropes. Use two conditions instead. For example, if you'd like to study Distance 6000, then use two C198 conditions: "more than 5900" and "less than 6100".  (Place those two conditions together in a TriggerGroup (can be called eg. with a C15 or a GlobalTrigger).

FREL_EQUAL:$0001; Used with Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION command, if the number you observe is equal with the required value.

FREL_MORE:$0002; Used with Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION command, if the number you observe is more than the required value.

FREL_LESS:$0004; Used with Parameters=PARAM_NUMBER_RELATION command, if the number you observe is less than the required value.

PARAM_OBJECT_ADDITIONAL: 3 ;Used with Parameters command.>I used this possibility in the triggers to define a Moveable or Static object (or their slots) with one or more additional parameters together that belong to that object.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_OBJECT_ADDITIONAL, IdParamList, ObjectIndex, ObjectAdditional1, ObjectAdditional2, NumberRelation>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_OBJECT_ADDITIONAL" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_OBJECT_ADDITIONAL command, 2 for second etc.>>ObjectIndex field>------------------>Type here the index of the required object, what you can see in ngle.>>Specified objects:>- F535, C243: only Ahmet>- F544, F545, F546, F547, C228: only Enemy Jeep>- F548, C230: only Baddy_1 or Baddy_2>- F549: only Wraith1>- F550: only Wraith2>- F551: only Wraith slots>- F552, C237: only Little Beetle emitter>- F553, C238: only Fish Emitter>- F554, C240: only Mutant>- F555, C205: only Falling Blocks>- F557: only Laser Head>- F559, C248: only Teeth Spikes>- F560, F561, F562, C249, C251, C252: only Joby Spike>- F563, C253: only Squishy Block2>- F566, C147: only Firerope>- F567: only Burning Floor>- F570: only Twoblock Platform>- F571, C136: only Mine>- F572, C135: only Grenade>- C138: only Expanding Platform>- C139: only Raising Block1 or Raising Block2>- C142: only Steam Emitter (blowing harmful steams)>- C144: only Flame Emitter (blowing flames horizontally/vertically)>- C203: only switches>- C245: only Hydra>- C246: only Rollingball>- C254: only Seth Blade>>In the case of F539, F576, C129, C221, type here the slot name.>>ObjectAdditional1 field>----------------------->This field could have different meanings in different triggers:>>F535/C243: click on the square whereto the Ahmet will be transported. Then see NGLE infobox, the "Selected Block" data. Type the value here what you see at "Y".>F539: type the sector value here (when the object look will swap for the MIP version, or vice verse).>F541: type the percent of the maximum vitality here.>F542: type IGNORE, if the command is for starting the feature. But if it is for stopping the feature, then type a percent value of the maximum vitality here - this is where the vulnerable vitality of the creature will be restored.>F544: type the speed value here. Approximately 1024 means 1 sector/second speed (recommended below 10000). (Type IGNORE, if you want to restore the default speed.)>F545: type the required value between shooting two grenades, in seconds (max. about 18 minutes). (Type IGNORE, if you want to restore the default time, which is 5 seconds.)>F546: type the required value (in seconds) when you want the next grenade to be shot. (0 = right away.)>F548: type here the ammo amount you want - maximum 32767. (If you want infinite ammunition, then type IGNORE.)>F549: type here one of these values:>>1 - each contact with Lara will ignite her + wraith is invulnerable (and harmful) in water>2 - each contact with Lara will not ignite her (but harmful) + wraith is invulnerable (and harmful) in water>3 - each contact with Lara will not ignite her (but harmful) + wraith is vulnerable in water>>If you want to restore the default properties (you need more than one contact to ignite Lara + the wraith is vulnerable in water), then type IGNORE.>F551: type here one of these values:>>Any positive number: circling like usually, but constantly downwards,>Any negative number: circling like usually, but constantly upwards,>0: circling like usually, but keeping constantly his Room Editor vertical position.>>The scale is not linear.

(0 = immediate stop.)>Type IGNORE if you want to keep performing the harmless rage "forever".>F555: type here the new time (in seconds) when the falling block will crash (max. about 18 minutes). (0 = immediate crash.)>Type IGNORE:>>- If you want to set the timer back to the default 2 seconds (only if the block is still not shivering).>- If you want to keep the block shivering "forever".>- If you want to abort "forever" or long shivering with an immediate crash.>>F557: usually type IGNORE here. But if you chose 10 in ObjectAdditional2 field, then type the ID of the effect you want.>Values are from 1 to 90.>There are 3 seconds (from 1 to 90 tick frames) when the head is getting energy. Each frame has a different energy effect. Naturally Frame1 has a "very low energy" effect but Frame90 has a "very high energy" effect. So, for example, ID40 effect means "the energy effect that belongs to Frame40".>(If you stop forcing this status, then the head stops getting energy in 91 minus ID tick frames, and shoots. - So eg. if ID is 40, then it will shoot in 91-40=51 tick frames.)>F559: type here the new time (in tick frames) between two extensions of the teeth spikes (max. about 18 minutes). (0 = immediate extension.)>Or type IGNORE if you use this trigger to restore the default time.>F560: when the joby spike has been triggered, first it rotates slowly, but after some seconds it reaches the maximum of its rotation speed.>Speed values are from 1 to (about) 32000. (Above 10000, the spike rotates very fast. 4100-whatever is the maximum value. - "Whatever", because it doesn't seem standard, but it sure that it is near 4100.)>Type here the speed value you want - see ObjectAdditional2 field to understand how it will work.>(Type here IGNORE, if you chose Case 3 in ObjectAdditional2 field, for abortion.)>F561: length values are from 0 to (about) 32000. (Probably Value 1260 means one block vertical distance.)>Type here the length value you want - see ObjectAdditional2 field to understand how it will work.>(Type here IGNORE, if you chose Case 3 in ObjectAdditional2 field, for abortion.)>F562: the values are just like in the case of F561.>The default maximum is when the tip of the spike extending reaches the floor.>F563: type here the new time (in seconds) that lasts till the shivering squishy block2 falls down (max. about 18 minutes). (0 = immediate fall.) - The default time is 2 seconds.>You can abort any timer, with an immediate fall.>F565: type here the index of the ColorRGB Script command, where the pulsing inner color light is stored.>Type IGNORE if you use the command to stop pulsing on this object.>F566: type here the new burning time (in seconds) that lasts till the rope crumbles (max. about 18 minutes). (0 = immediate crumble.) - The default time is 5 seconds.>Type IGNORE for infinite burning.>You cannot change or restart the timer if the rope is already burning, but you can abort it with an immediate crumble.>F570: type here the destination position. (Eg. 5 = Floor Level 5, 0 = Floor Level 0, -1 = Floor Level -1 etc.)>F571: type here the new time (in seconds) that lasts till the flaming mine explodes (max. about 18 minutes). (0 = immediate explosion.) - The default time is 5 seconds.>You can abort any timer, with an immediate explosion.>F572: type here the new time (in seconds) that lasts till the exploding effect stops (max. about 18 minutes). - The default time is only half a second.>Type 0 to abort a previous customized time. (Don't use Timer 0 for other reasons!)>Type IGNORE for an "infinite" effect.>F576, C129: type here the number that refers to the required status:>>0 - none of the meshes are shatterable>1 - only Mesh 0 is shatterable>2 - only Mesh 1 is shatterable>4 - only Mesh 2 is shatterable>8 - only Mesh 3 is shatterable>16 - only Mesh 4 is shatterable>32 - only Mesh 5 is shatterable>64 - only Mesh 6 is shatterable>128 - only Mesh 7 is shatterable>256 - only Mesh 8 is shatterable>512 - only Mesh 9 is shatterable>1024 - only Mesh 10 is shatterable>2048 - only Mesh 11 is shatterable>4096 - only Mesh 12 is shatterable>8192 - only Mesh 13 is shatterable>16384 - only Mesh 14 is shatterable>>The values will be added with more meshes. For example, you want to shatter Mesh9 and Mesh11, that’s why the value is 512+2048=2560, because Mesh9 is 512 and Mesh11 is 2048.>Type IGNORE here if you want to use only the possibilities of ObjectAdditional2 field.>Type IGNORE here and in ObjectAdditional2 field as well if you want all the meshes shatterable.>>C117: type here the animation ID of the required object slot (from WADMerger Animation Editor).>Note: if it is a vehicle animation slot of Lara (like VEHICLE_EXTRA), then open the Animation Watcher in NG Center, choose "Show Present Animations" mode, then select that vehicle animation slot. See the column of the required animation, and the ABS value next to it. What you type now is that ABS value, not the animation value.>But be careful! Always check that value if you finshed editing your WAD, because the ABS value may change if you add/remove an animation or an object slot to/from your WAD.>C177 and C178: you check object timers typed in triggers in these conditions. Type the timer here (in seconds, positive always) what you typed in those object triggers. (For C177: it works only for "more" and "more or equal" conditions, it could be IGNORE for "equal", "less", "less or equal" conditions.

So, if you want noticeable changes in the position of the Sun when you change the coordinates, then don’t be afraid of big/huge changes with those numbers.>- The coordinates never affect the sun size.>- The coordinates affect each other. For example, if the sun is in a higher position, then the same horizontal distance seems smaller.

For example, if the speed is 100 for north and 100 for east, then the sun will move on a vector that has exactly 45 degrees with the north direction and also 45 degrees with the east direction.>But if the speed is 100 for north and 20 for east, then the sun will move almost exactly northwards, moving only a bit eastwards in the meantime.>>Notes:>>1. Maximum one move at the same time!>2. If you need only one direction, then choose F524, that has a better control for the movement.>3. If you don't like the sun track then you need to change the other parameters before (or during) the move.

FSUN_NORTH:$0001; Used with Parameters=PARAM_SUN_COMPLEX command, if the sun moves northwards.

FSUN_SOUTH:$0002; Used with Parameters=PARAM_SUN_COMPLEX command, if the sun moves southwards.

FSUN_EAST:$0004; Used with Parameters=PARAM_SUN_COMPLEX command, if the sun moves eastwards.

PARAM_GET_VEHICLE: 8 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will add parameters to F532 (always HEAVY) and F533 triggers, when we make Lara get out of/off/in/on a vehicle.>>Notes:>>- You shouldn’t let the trigger be activated under complicated circumstances (except: using FGVEH_ANIM flag). Eg. if Lara is driving the motorbike upwards on a slope, then she is tilted backwards when the trigger is being activated – so, after the activation she will still be tilted backwards, on feet.>Or: if F532 moves Lara off the vehicle when she is just taking a sharp curve, tilted heavily, then the motorbike remains tilted heavily, Lara won't be able to get back on it again.>- F532 FGVEH_CUT triggers should be One Shot/Single Shot/Single Shot Resumed in the map, or else Lara can't get back on/in the vehicle, since it is still in the trigger zone. (Or the trigger needs to be only GlobalTrigger-controlled. Or you need some other trick, like disabling the trigger temporarily with a TRIGGER_TRIGGERER, moving the vehicle out of the trigger zone with Action triggers etc.)>F532 FGVEH_ANIM triggers can also have the same bad effect if you are very slow, and the vehicle will stop at the end of the braking distance before leaving the trigger zone.>One Shot also recommended for F533 triggers so Lara won't get on/in later in the game, unintentionally.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_GET_VEHICLE, IdParamList, Flags (FGVEH_...), Animation, Vehicle, StartPosID>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_GET_VEHICLE" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_GET_VEHICLE command, 2 for second etc.>>Flags (FGVEH_...) field>----------------------->For the time being you need to use this field only if Lara gets out/off the vehicle, with F532.

After that ends (activate the trigger now) then Lara will be on/in a vehicle.>- You start a cutscene/movie when Lara is on/in a vehicle. After that ends (activate the trigger now) then Lara will be on/in another vehicle.>- As the trigger name says, it works only with jeep or motorbike. But probably you don’t need this trigger if Lara leaves the level on/in motorbike/jeep and starts the next level on/in motorbike/jeep:>Just place that vehicle in the new level anywhere. Use the trigger only if you have both jeep/motorbike in the new level, and you experience the wrong vehicle of them with Lara just after the level jump. In that case the trigger will place Lara on/in the proper vehicle.>>There is no “getting in/on” animation being performed ever for F533! Because there could be too many things to do in that setup to get rid of bugs.>>Known bug of F533:>If you save the game after using this trigger (having Lara on/in the vehicle, moving/turning with it) and then load it, then Lara will be still on/in the vehicle, but in a motionless animation, speed and the turning was annulled. If Lara gets out/off manually, then this bug won't happen again, travelling further with the vehicle.>>Notes for F533:>>- You can make her get in the jeep this way even without having the jeep key. If you don't like it, then add an "if jeep key in the inventory" condition to this trigger.>- Jeeps have a 098.wav (inside) and 110.wav (outside) audio "hardcodedly". With this setup, you will hear any (already playing) level background loop audio now, sitting in the jeep. If you get out now, you will hear 110.wav, and if you get back in, then you will hear 098.wav, as usual.>You can fix these things, using "if Lara is driving the jeep", "if Lara is not driving the jeep" GlobalTriggers (probably FGT_SINGLE_SHOT_RESUMED), starting any (required) audio with the proper condition.>>Animation field>--------------->If it is an F532 trigger with FGVEH_ANIM flag, then type here the object slot, where Lara's driving animations are stored: VEHICLE_EXTRA, MOTORBIKE_LARA, MOTOR_BOAT_LARA, RUBBER_BOAT_LARA, KAYAK_LARA (tested only for jeep, motorbike, motorboat, rubberboat, kayak).>If it is an F533 trigger, then only jeep or motorbike is useable, so type only VEHICLE_EXTRA or MOTORBIKE_LARA.>If it is an F532 trigger with FGVEH_CUT flag, then type IGNORE.>>Vehicle field>------------->If it is an F533 trigger then type here the object ID of the vehicle.>If it is an F532 trigger, then type IGNORE here.>>StartPosID field>---------------->You need to type the OCB of a LARA_START_POS object here, in these situations:>>- F532 with FGVEH_CUT flag: if you don't want to see Lara next to the vehicle. (See the description of the flag.)>- If it is an F533 trigger, then you can have a camera bug: the chase camera will go into the proper position probably only if Lara starts moving with the vehicle. You can fix it easily, if Lara and the vehicle has the same facing - but only if they are on the same square. It is good for a leveljump, but not if it happens after the end of a cutscene, during the same level. (Because you can't use a Lara object now to detect her position after the cutscene.) In that case you need a LARA_START_POS on the square of the vehicle.>>Both in the cases: if Lara has a bad facing after activating the trigger, then you must rotate the LARA_START_POS.>>Type IGNORE here:>- if it is an F532 trigger with FGVEH_ANIM flag, or>- if it is an F532 trigger with FGVEH_CUT flag, but you want to see Lara next to the vehicle, or>- if it is an F533 trigger, but you don't need a LARA_START_POS against the camera bug.

FGVEH_CUT:$0001; Used with Parameters=PARAM_GET_VEHICLE command.>Choose this flag if you want Lara to get out of/off the vehicle between the border of game segments. For example, this is what you see: "in the cutscene Lara drives a vehicle. Then the cutscene ends. The screen blacks out, then lightens. You will see Lara, already being out of the vehicle, standing next to the vehicle".>So never choose this if you want to see Lara getting out/off in the effective game, performing a getting-out/off animation.>>In these cases you need to activate this trigger when the cutscene ends. The vehicle stops where it just is, and Lara will be placed automatically next to it.>>It is hard to do it without serious animation bugs in the case of water vehicles, that is why FGVEH_CUT is made and tested only for jeep or motorbike!>>Notes:>>- Lara will always perform the motionless standing animation (Animation103) after performing this trigger. So you need the proper place next to the vehicle, where she can perform this.> - Perhaps you don't want to see Lara next to the vehicle now (always on the right side). In that case you need to type the OCB of a LARA_START_POS object in StartPosID field of the PARAM_GET_VEHICLE command. Lara will be transported whereto LARA_START_POS object is placed.>- The trigger is also useful if it is not after a cutscene.  Now Lara Lara leaves the level on a vehicle, but when the new level starts then she will be standing next to the vehicle. Lara object will activate the trigger when the level starts. (But don’t forget: you need to place the vehicle anywhere in the new level to prevent the game from crashing.)>- If it is not after a leveljump, then the first time when you start with the vehicle again, then perhaps the speed will be too big for one or two seconds and some vehicle may rotate a bit even before the start. And perhaps you can't reverse before you don't move forwards at least a bit.>- Jeep has a hardcoded audio when Lara is driving it. If you make her get out with this trigger then that audio won't be stopped by itself, as usual, you need an audio trigger as well, to change it manually.

FGVEH_ANIM:$0002; Used with Parameters=PARAM_GET_VEHICLE command.>Choose this flag if you want to see Lara performing a getting-out/off animation.>>Notes:>>- The situation caused by this flag is very spectacular, but not really precise. I mean, when you start the trigger, then the vehicle start braking, and it stops only at the end of the braking distance, in a hardly computable position.>- You can get out either rightwards or leftwards if it is a motorboat, a rubberboat or a kayak. This will be performed randomly, unless you choose the way with FGVEH_LEFT or FGVEH_RIGHT flags.>(Be careful, if the kayak is too close to the shore, then Lara can't get jump out to the shore, you will need to quit the game. Jump always to the direction of the water now.)

FGVEH_LEFT:$0004; Used with Parameters=PARAM_GET_VEHICLE command, if you use an FGVEH_ANIM flag. Add it to FGVEH_ANIM, if you want Lara to get ouf of the motorboat, rubberboat or kayak leftwards.

FGVEH_RIGHT:$0008; Used with Parameters=PARAM_GET_VEHICLE command, if you use an FGVEH_ANIM flag. Add it to FGVEH_ANIM, if you want Lara to get ouf of the motorboat, rubberboat or kayak rightwards.

PARAM_ITEM_INTERACTION: 9 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will control to enable/disable the interaction of Lara with the items, in F534 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_ITEM_INTERACTION, IdParamList, ItemID, MainParameter, ChangeSlot, ChangeNumber>>Methods used to enable/disable interactions:>>- forcing a fake StateID (lever switch, jump switch, underwater wall/ceiling switch)>- forcing a non-existing animation (switch type 1/6: wall lever on dry land, wall button, valve switch, keypad, hole switch)>- the original method to disable pulley in TRLR:  till the obelisks turned into the right positions, the pulley is disabled (but you don't need the obelisk setup now)>- the original method to disable crowbar switch in TRLR: the switch is useless, when a BABOON_NORMAL has been triggered in the same room (but you don't need the baboon setup now)>- forcing slot-related flags (falling block - crash by step)>- forcing general item flags (floor/ceiling trapdoor. pushpull/kick door, underwater door, double door, sarcophagus, zipline handle - deathslide)>- forcing a fake object slot (all the others, like breakable and shootable switch type 7/8, firerope, crowbar doors, pickups etc.)>>See the "MainParameter" field below to understand which method requires what.>>Notes:>>- In most of the methods, you can have any amount of disabled items. But if it is the method of "fake object slot", then you can have maximum five disabled items of that method at the same time.>- If Lara doesn't have a manual interaction with an item, then you don't need any "trick" like F534. For example, if you want to disable a falling block that can be started by a trigger (not by step), then just disable the trigger with a TRIGGER_TRIGGERER.>- See OCB’s for pushblocks to enable/disable some interaction types of them.>- See A77 and A78 triggers to enable/disable tightropes. (A77 is not savegame-stable, you need eg. a "loaded game" GlobalTrigger, to re-activate A77 - enabled after the original A77 is used, disabled after A78 is used.)>- You can also try TestPosition Script command to disable/enable items interaction: disable/enable ACTION button, if Lara is/is not in that position.>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_ITEM_INTERACTION" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_ITEM_INTERACTION command, 2 for second etc.>>ItemID field>------------>Type here the index of the item.>>MainParameter field>------------------->- If you force a fake StateID:>This method made with these basic parameters: "being in OFF position" = Animation 0+State ID 0, "being in ON position": Animation 2+State ID 1, forced (unused) State ID: 3.I tested it with lever switch, jump switch, underwater switch, it is true for all of them, they all have to work with these parameters.>So this is "hardcoded", you don't need to add any custom parameter. Type IGNORE.>>- If you force a non-existing animation:>Switch Type 1/6 switches can use different Lara animations, depending on what number you type in their OCB window.>The proper OCB codes:>>a, It is 0 usually.>b, See WADMerger Switch Manager.>c, See _NEW Switch 1/2/3 in NG Center/Reference/OCB list. (According to my experiences it will work not only for SWITCH_TYPE1, 2 or 3 but even for some other SWITCH_TYPEs.)>>Type this OCB number here as well. (This OCB will be removed temporarily while the switch is disabled.)>>- If you disable a pulley:>Everything is "hardcoded" now, you don't need the obelisk setup or an obelisk. Type IGNORE.>>- If you disable a crowbar switch:>Everything is "hardcoded" now, you don't need the baboon. Type IGNORE.>>- If you disable a falling block with slot flags or if you force general item flags:>You need to type 1111 here. This number will be forced in the OCB of the object with an F534 in "enable" mode - and this will be removed there with an F534 in "disable" mode.>>Important!>Fake StateID, pulley and crowbar switch methods also need this temporary OCB 1111, but in their case you don't need to type this 1111 anywhere, it will be set in a hardcoded way.>(The usual OCB 1 of the pulley will be restored if the pulley is enabled again.)>>Note:>Pulley is the only setup now, when Lara says "no", trying a disabled thing. (It is hardcoded from TRLR, not something I did.)>>- If you force a fake object slot:>Type here the original object slot.>>ChangeSlot field>---------------->If you force a fake object slot, then type here a Moveable object slot. This is where you need to store the exact copy of the object.>>Be careful, if you force a fake slot:>>- Some forced slot don't have collision (by default) when the original slot needs them, and vice verse.>- Always test this situation even in savegames. For example, my experience is when you want to force a fake slot for a vehicle, when Lara wants to get on/in (so she can't do that), then the fake vehicle will be gone if you save/load the game after that. So the method seems useless with vehicles.>- The fake slot will always force the basic status of the item. (Eg. force the fake firerope before catching fire.) Which is naturally good, but you need to know that if you'd like to force another status of the item.>- This setup won’t work with breakable/shootable switches that are active (moving) before hitting them (like SWITCH_TYPE7 of City of the Dead).>- Breakable/shootable switches that should be move when Lara’s bullet hits them (like SWITCH_TYPE8 of The Lost Library) won’t move if they are being disabled when Lara hits them.>>In other cases type IGNORE.>>ChangeNumber field>------------------>As I said above, you have maximum five items at the same time for the fake slot method. They need the ID of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Type this ID here.>>You can use an ID any times in the same level, but:>>- Always the latest usage of the ID will be valid. (So use an ID again only if you don't need a previous setup any more with that ID.)>- Never choose an ID if that ID is just used for another (just disabled) item. Use that ID only if that item got re-enabled.>>In other cases type IGNORE.>>Natural situations to open closed doors>--------------------------------------->Usually there is a keyhole next to the door, so the door will open, automatically, only if Lara uses a key in the keyhole. That is not really realistic. Lara opens pushpull doors personally, that is realistic, but pushpull doors are only shut, you can never close them.>A natural situation with a closed pushpull door is: “The player uses ACTION button to open it, but the door cannot open. If Lara uses the key directly on the door, then the door will open, if the player uses ACTION after that”. - If you want to achieve that, then you need this workaround:>>- First an F534 needs to be activated anywhere else in the level to disable the door. – After that ACTION is useless to open the door, if the key is not in the inventory. Then:>- Place an invisible keyhole on the door. (Just as on the door in Coastal Ruins in the mouth of the tunnel towards the Catacombs). There are a KEY trigger and another F534 trigger below the keyhole. If the player uses ACTION, when the key is the inventory, then F534 will enable the door.>- After that another ACTION is useful to open the door, the usual way: Lara grabs the doorknob.>>The setup could be more interesting, if you use the “Lara tries the doorknob but the door is closed” custom animation of AOD. The GlobalTrigger, that will perform the animation, has these conditions: “if the door is disabled” and “if the door is performing the closed animation” and “if Lara's hands are free” and “if she is in the required position to the door - see: TestPosition Script command” - and “if she's performing Animation103”, and “if CTRL is being used”.>And you need another GlobalTrigger now to disable all the keys while Lara's performing the custom animation, so eg. she will not be able to draw weapons when trying the door.

PARAM_SWITCH_USAGE: 10 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will count how many times you used a switch.>F536 trigger is needful to start counting, before you check it with a C203.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_SWITCH_USAGE, IdParamList, SwitchID, AnimOn, AnimOff, CaseNumber>>Note:>Useless with any switch not having clear on and off animations (like pulley, cog switch).>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_SWITCH_USAGE" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_SWITCH_USAGE command, 2 for second etc.>>SwitchID field>-------------->Type here the ID of that switch.>>AnimOn field>------------>This is the WADMerger Animation Editor ID of "the switch moves to ON position" animation of the switch.>>AnimOff field>------------>This is the WADMerger Animation Editor ID of "the switch moves to OFF position" animation of the switch.>>CaseNumber field>--------------->You have maximum five switches at the same time, to count their uses. They need the ID of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. >Type this ID here.>>You can use an ID any times in the same level, but always the latest usage of the ID will be valid. (So use an ID again only if you don't need a previous setup any more with that ID, if you stopped that setup with another F536.)

PARAM_ROOM_PROPERTIES: 11 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will check in C211 conditions the actual parameters of a room.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_ROOM_PROPERTIES, IdParamList, Flags (FRPROP_...), Index, RoomType, Flipmap, Red, Green, Blue, RoomX, RoomY, Floor, Ceiling, XSize, YSize, Lights, Statics>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_ROOM_PROPERTIES" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_ROOM_PROPERTIES command, 2 for second etc.>>Flags (FRPROP_...) field>------------------------>You choose here the method to select the room: based on a room index or the actual room of Lara/the required Moveable object.>>Index field>----------->Except in the case of Lara, you need an index (room index or object index), according to what you chose in Flags (FRPROP_...) field.>>The room index is what you usually see in NGLE.

I mean, for example, a room with Rain flag has no rain if it is not an outside room.>- Don't misunderstand: you don't need to check all the actual types. So, for example, if the room is an outside+non-lens flare room, and you want to check only if outside is true, then you don't need to check non-lens flare, if you don't want to.>>Flipmap field>------------->Type 1111 if you want a true condition only if the room (not a fliproom) has no fliproom.>Type 2222 if you want a true condition only if the room (not a fliproom) has a fliproom in any flipmap.>Type 3333 if the room is a fliproom, in any flipmap.>Type a flipmap ID+4000 if you want a true condition only if the room (not a fliproom) has a fliproom in that flipmap.

FRPROP_ROOM:$0001; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ROOM_PROPERTIES command. Choose this flag, if you want to define the room with the room index.>>Note:>FRPROP_ROOM cannot be specified for flipped rooms! Always choose the index of an "original" room, never choose a flipped index.>If a room has both an original and a flipped version, then always the properties of the actual (original or flipped) version will be checked.

FRPROP_LARA:$0002; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ROOM_PROPERTIES command. Choose this flag, if you want to define the room as the actual room of Lara.>>Notes:>>- If Lara is in a flipped room, then these are the properties of the flipped version of the room, not the original version.>- The object pivot helps to understand what an "actual" room is.>For example, if Lara is standing in knee-deep water, then her pivot (butt) is out of water, so she is in a dry room.>But, if she is standing in a waist-deep water, then her butt is below the water surface, so she is in a water room.

FRPROP_OBJECT:$0004; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ROOM_PROPERTIES command. Choose this flag, if you want to define the room as the actual room of the required Moveable object.>>Notes:>>- If the object is in a flipped room, then these are the properties of the flipped version of the room, not the original version.>- The object pivot indicates the room of the object, which is important eg. if the baddy stands in a vertical portal, having his legs in the lower room, having his upper body in the upper room.

FOCBCH_MOVEABLE:$0008; Used with Parameters=PARAM_OCB_CHANGE command. Add it to FOCBCH_CHANGE, ADD or REMOVE flag, which means you will use a Moveable index in this command.

FOCBCH_STATIC:$0010; Used with Parameters=PARAM_OCB_CHANGE command. Add it to FOCBCH_CHANGE, ADD or REMOVE flag, which means you will use a Static index in this command.

PARAM_ORIENTATION_CONTROL: 13 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will control the orientation of a Moveable or a Static object, in C215 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_ORIENTATION_CONTROL, IdParamList, Flags (FORC_...), Object, OrientationMin, OrientationMax>>Note:>Be careful when we say "the object is facing a direction".>I mean, the "face" of the object is the side of the object which will always see the east if you have just placed the object in the Room Editor.

It means the object faces a 10 degrees sized interval: 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360 (=0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.>>- An "equal" condition is "too exact", perhaps it will never be true. If you'd like to check eg. exactly 17 degrees, then perhaps you should check "more than 15" and "less than 19" instead.>It depends on the speed of the rotation as well. I mean, if the object turns very fast, then perhaps that 15-19 interval is still too thin for that, the object will jump from 13 degrees to 20 degress when turning, never being in the 15-19 interval.>(Yes, even if the rotation looks smooth, the detected position could jump some values!) 

FORC_VERTICAL:$0001; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ORIENTATION_CONTROL command, if you want to check the rotation around the vertical axis.>>0 degrees is exactly north, then you can count the further values in clockwise. So 90 degrees is exactly east, 180 degrees is exactly south, 270 degrees is exactly west. (Room Editor facing, not game facing!

FORC_HORIZONTAL1:$0002; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ORIENTATION_CONTROL command, if you want to check the rotation around the first horizontal axis.>>0 degrees is exactly the default position, then you can count the further values in clockwise. So 90 degrees means the object is turned exactly right, 180 degrees means the object is turned exactly upside down, 270 means the object is turned exactly left.>The biggest value is naturally 359.>>Useless with Static objects!

FORC_HORIZONTAL2:$0004; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ORIENTATION_CONTROL command, if you want to check the rotation around the second horizontal axis.>>0 degrees is exactly the default position, then you can count the further values in clockwise. So 90 degrees means the object faces exactly the floor, 180 degrees means the object is turned exactly upside down, 270 means the object faces exactly the ceiling.>The biggest value is naturally 359.>>Useless with Static objects!

FORC_MOVEABLE:$0008; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ORIENTATION_CONTROL command. Add it to FORC_VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL1 or HORIZONTAL2 flag, which means you will use a Moveable index in this command.

FORC_STATIC:$0010; Used with Parameters=PARAM_ORIENTATION_CONTROL command. Add it to FORC_VERTICAL flag, which means you will use a Static index in this command.

PARAM_EARTHQUAKE: 14 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will customize the earthquakes, in F538 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_EARTHQUAKE, IdParamList, QuakeType, Intensity, Timer, Sound>>Note:>These quakes don't require EARTHQUAKE objects.

QUAKE_DECREASING:1; Used with Parameters=PARAM_EARTHQUAKE command.>A quake that starts with huge or extra huge quakes, then it starts decreasing by degrees immediately, by itself, till it stops by itself soon.

QUAKE_STANDARD:2; Used with Parameters=PARAM_EARTHQUAKE command.>A quake that performs a standard intensity. If you abort it with the Timer in the command, or another F538, then it starts decreasing by degrees, till it stops by itself soon.

QUAKE_SINGLE:3; Used with Parameters=PARAM_EARTHQUAKE command.>It just performs a single jerk.

PARAM_ROLLINGBALL_ROUTE: 15 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will customize the speed and route of rollingballs, in F558 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_ROLLINGBALL_ROUTE, IdParamList, BallIndex, CaseIndex, NorthSouthSpeed, WestEastSpeed>>Either the ball is already rolling or still moveless, you can make it move in the required direction, with the required speed, not caring about "the rules of physics".>>(Approximately?) 512 means the speed of the ball is just enough for a one square long travel. Under "normal" circumstances it means if the ball is on a horizontal route, then the speed starts decreasing now, so the ball stops after travelling one square.>But now this speed will be kept till you abort it, the ball won't stop after travelling one square.>>A few examples:>>- The ball is rolling down slow on a sharp slope.>- The ball is shooting out fast on a totally horizontal floor like a cannonball.>- The ball is rolling along the horizontal corridors of a maze, turning left/right in the intersections.>>Notes:>- The forced speed is always constant, unlikely the default one. You need to accept it.>- HEAVY triggers are important in this setup. These triggers are activated by the rollingball, and the trigger subject itself is also the rollingball. Two examples:>>a, If an obstacle should stop the ball, then the ball will be stuck there, rolling with the forced speed. This is unreal, naturally, so you should place a HEAVY trigger on that square, that stops the effect.>b, When the ball should turn left/right in a maze, and the ball reaches the intersection, the HEAVY trigger there activates another F558, so the ball turns into another direction.>>- In the other aspects, "the rules of physics" will work properly. That is why you need to be thoughtful when you plan the route of the ball, perhaps it moves in a more or less different way than you want it. For example, if the speed is high when you want it to turn with a HEAVY from East to North direction, then the speed will roll it eastwards further, even after the HEAVY trigger, before it turns to North.>Another main aspect is the gravitation.>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_ROLLINGBALL_ROUTE" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_ROLLINGBALL_ROUTE command, 2 for second etc.>>BallIndex field>--------------->The object index of the rollingball you can see in NGLE.>>CaseIndex field>--------------->You need to add a case ID to the ball: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.>I mean, you can have maximum five rollingballs at the same time, with forced speed like that.>You need an F558 to stop every speed force on a ball, before you use its case ID again for another ball.>>NorthSouthSpeed field>--------------------->Type here the speed of the North/South direction (according to NGLE facing).>>Negative number: North>Positive number: South>>Type IGNORE if you don't want to force the ball in this direction.>>WestEastSpeed field>------------------->Type here the speed of the West/East direction (according to NGLE facing).>>Negative number: West>Positive number: East>>Type IGNORE if you don't want to force the ball in this direction.

PARAM_SPRINKLER_SEQUENCE: 16 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will customize the shower/drip time of sprinklers, in F564 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_SPRINKLER_SEQUENCE, IdParamList, SprinklerIndex, CaseIndex, Shower, Drip>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_SPRINKLER_SEQUENCE" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_SPRINKLER_SEQUENCE command, 2 for second etc.>>SprinklerIndex field>-------------------->The object index of the sprinkler you can see in NGLE.>>CaseIndex field>--------------->You need to add a case ID to the sprinkler: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.>I mean, you can have maximum five sprinklers at the same time, with forced shower/drip time like that.>You need to wait till the sprinkler stops at the end of the second (dripping) phase, before you use its case ID again for another sprinkler.>>Shower field>------------>This will customize (in seconds) the time of the first phase of the sprinkler: the showering.>Type 0 if you want to skip this phase. (So if you want only the dripping phase.)>Type -1 (IGNORE) if you want this phase "forever". You need another F564 to stop this infinite effect. Now the sequence will continue immediately with the second (dripping) phase.>>Drip field>---------->This will customize (in seconds) the time of the second (last) phase of the sprinkler: the dripping.>Type 0 if you want to skip this phase. (So if you want only the showering phase.)>Type -1 (IGNORE) if you want this phase "forever". You need another F564 to stop this infinite effect. Now the sequence will stop immediately.

PARAM_FLAME_BLOWN: 17 ;Used with Parameters command, only for flame emitters that blow flames horizontally or vertically.>This will customize the blows, in F568 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_FLAME_BLOWN, IdParamList, FlameIndex, CaseIndex, Disable, ContVertical, Length>>Note:>F568 also activates the flame if it is still not active.>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_FLAME_BLOWN" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_FLAME_BLOWN command, 2 for second etc.>>FlameIndex field>-------------------->The object index of the flame emitter you can see in NGLE.>>CaseIndex field>--------------->You need to add a case ID to the emitter: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.>I mean, you can have maximum five flame blowing emitters at the same time, with customization like that.>You need another F568 to abort the infinite effects of Disable, ContVertical or Length field, before you use its case ID again for another emitter.>>Disable field>------------->If you type START here, then:>>- if there is just an actual flame, then the flame will be stopped at once, and the further flames will be disabled, or>- if there is no actual flame, then the further flames will be disabled.>>Type IGNORE if you don't want this effect now.>>Notes:>- "Disabling" and "antitriggering" are not the same. Because the basic flame is not shown if you antitrigger the emitter.>- If you stop this infinite effect, then the next blow starts at once.>- You can't use ContVertical/Length fields if you also use Disable field at the same time.>>ContVertical field>------------------>You can adjust continuous horizontal flames with OCB, but OCB is useless for continuous vertical flames.>That is why type START here, if you want a continuous vertical flame.>Choose any OCB for a vertical blow before forcing this status.>Type IGNORE if you don't want this effect now.>>Notes:>- This continuous flame will be started at once, either the emitter is just blowing that non-continuous blow of the OCB or not.>- If you stop this infinite effect, the flame starts working based on its OCB. The first step of this is a whole pause.>>Length field>------------>If the flame is continuous, then you can use shorter flames than the default one. Type here the proper percent number to identify the length. So eg. 65 means "65% of the default length".>Type IGNORE if you don't want this effect now.>>Notes:>- The effect probably fails if the continuous flames are horizontal, made by "continuous" OCB. So make it continuous as if it were a vertical flame (i.e. using a non-continuous horizontal OCB+START in ContVertical field), to fix this bug.>So, as you see, Length field is always useless without a START in ContVertical field!>- If you don't want a continuous flame for the customized length, then you can use a trick of a loop Organizer: the first F568 starts the effect, the second one stops it.>- You cannot change the flame direction. (So, eg. a vertical flame upwards will never be blown downwards.)

PARAM_STEAM_BLOWN: 18 ;Used with Parameters command, only for steam emitters that blow harmful steam.>This will customize the blows, in F569 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_STEAM_BLOWN, IdParamList, SteamIndex, CaseIndex, Disable, Length>>Note:>F569 also activates the steam if it is still not active.>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_STEAM_BLOWN" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_STEAM_BLOWN command, 2 for second etc.>>SteamIndex field>---------------->The object index of the steam emitter you can see in NGLE.>>CaseIndex field>--------------->You need to add a case ID to the emitter: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.>I mean, you can have maximum five steam emitters at the same time, with customization like that.>You need another F569 to abort the infinite effects of Disable or Length field, before you use its case ID again for another emitter.>>Disable field>------------->If you type START here, then:>>- if there is just an actual steam, then the steam will be stopped at once, and the further steams will be disabled, or>- if there is no actual steam, then the further steams will be disabled.>>Type IGNORE if you don't want this effect now.>>Notes:>- "Disabling" and "antitriggering" are not the same. Because the basic steam is not shown if you antitrigger the emitter.>- If you stop this infinite effect, then the next blow starts at once.>- You can't use Length field if you also use Disable field at the same time.>>Length field>------------>You can adjust steams with different length than the default one. Type here the proper number to identify the length:>>1 (12.5 %)>2 (25 %)>3 (50 %)>4 (2×)>5 (4×)>6 (8×)>>Type IGNORE if you don't want this effect now.>>Notes:>- Perhaps the longer ones don't look really nice.>- It also makes the emitter continuous, whatever else the OCB wants.>- If you don't want a continuous steam for the customized length, then you can use a trick of a loop Organizer: the first F569 starts the effect, the second one stops it.>- If you stop this infinite effect, the steam starts working based on its OCB. The first step of this is a whole pause.>- You cannot change the steam direction.

PARAM_INVENTORY_ITEM: 19 ;Used with Parameters command.>This will customize the parameters of the required item in the inventory, in F584 triggers.>>Syntax: Parameters=PARAM_INVENTORY_ITEM, IdParamList, ItemName, VertPos, Size, XOrient, YOrient, ZOrient, Rotation>>IdParamList field>----------------->This is a progressive number to identify this "Parameters=PARAM_INVENTORY_ITEM" command script in trigger window of ngle.>You'll type 1, for your first PARAM_INVENTORY_ITEM command, 2 for second etc.>>ItemName field>-------------->Type here the ID of any (!) [Strings] (not [ExtraNG] !) string. This is where the item name you can see in the inventory is stored.>Type IGNORE, if you want to keep the previous name.>>Note:>The compass never shows a name so you can't change it, always type IGNORE.>>VertPos field>------------->Let's define BLEP: "Blue Line End Point". So, open the item in Animation Editor of WADMerger. See the item there in "Animation0" state, at Frame0. The BLEP of this item is where that long, blue line ends at the item.>If the value of this field is 0 that means the BLEP of the item is - approximately? - halfway between the upper edge of the screen and the name of the item, in the inventory.>If you type a positive number, that means the item will be at that amount of pixels, above that Level 0.>If you type a negative number, that means the item will be at that amount of pixels, below that Level 0.>Type IGNORE, if you want to keep the previous position.>>Notes:>- You can't choose "-1 pixel", because -1 means "IGNORE".>- In the case of the compass, Level 0 is naturally somewhere else. I mean, the default value of the compass is "14 pixels above its Level 0".>>Size field>---------->The bigger the value typed here is the smaller the item looks.>The smaller the value typed here is the bigger the item looks.>Type IGNORE, if you want to keep the previous size.>>Notes:>- For a reference: 1024 seems about a "normal" size usually. The twice of it means the item is half-sized.>- It also works for the compass.>>XOrient field>------------->See the item in Animation Editor, in “Animation0” state (at Frame0). The item is at one end of the long, blue line. Imagine a camera at the other end of the blue line. The longitudinal axis of the camera view is the blue line. - Now imagine that camera as your eyes looking at the inventory screen. Now you can see the item in the inventory in the default orientation state of the item, i.e. when XOrient=0, YOrient=0, ZOrient=0.>Click on "Move the selected mesh" button on the upper part of the editor (which looks like some cross). You will see the item axes:>>- X vertical axis (green)>- Y horizontal axis (red)>- Z horizontal axis (blue)>>If the inventory items are not selected in the inventory, then they don’t move, you can see them in a given angle. You can change the angle if you turn the item around its X, Y, Z axes.>Type a value here between 0 and 359, to turn the item clockwise with that degree, around X axis, compared to the default orientation X status.>(When we say "clockwise", then we always look at the required axis from the direction where WADMerger Animation Editor has a tiny ball at the end of the axis.)>Type IGNORE, if you want to keep the previous X orientation.>>Note:>It also works for the compass.>>YOrient field>------------->Type a value here between 0 and 359, to turn the item clockwise with that degree, around Y axis, compared to the default orientation Y status.>See XOrient field for more info.>Type IGNORE, if you want to keep the previous Y orientation.>>ZOrient field>------------->Type a value here between 0 and 359, to turn the item clockwise with that degree, around Z axis, compared to the default orientation Z status.>See XOrient field for more info.>Type IGNORE, if you want to keep the previous Z orientation.>>Rotation field>-------------->The basic values here are:>>0: the item is NOT being rotated in the inventory when selected>2: the item is being rotated in the inventory when selected>>But you can add further, special values to 0 or 2, if you need them:>>8: use this value if Lara uses a crowbar to get the item, so the item has an “I’ve been pried off the wall so I’m falling down now” animation. (My experience with some other objects: using this value, the object will be a bit lower in the right bottom corner of the screen just after Lara has picked up the item.)>8192: you need to use this for PUZZLE_ITEM8 Mine Detonator>16384: you need to use this for PICKUP_ITEM2 Jerrycan>32768: you need to use this for PICKUP_ITEM1 Bag of Sand>>Type IGNORE, if you want to keep the previous rotation status.>>Note:>No effect with the compass, always type IGNORE.
